# URL Shortner

# About:
This is a URL shortener project that allows users to convert long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. The project aims to simplify the sharing of URLs, particularly in situations where space or character limitations are a concern, such as social media platforms or messaging applications.

# Features:
  * Shorten URLs: Convert long URLs into shorter, unique links.
  * Custom Short Codes: Optionally, users can choose custom short codes for their URLs.
  * Redirection: When users access the shortened URL, they are redirected to the original long URL.
  * Analytics: Track the number of clicks and other analytics for each shortened URL.
  * User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow registered users to manage their shortened URLs.
